# Introduction
In the course "Natural Language Programming", my group and I were tasked to come up with an idea for useful NLP tool and build a prototype in python code. We built a tool that allows to analyse not only the overall sentiment of Youtube comments but also provides below listed functions. For our prototype we scraped comments from youtube videos about three models (A-Class, C-Class and E-Class) of Mercedes Benz - and demonstrated which insights the product and marketing team of Mercedes-Benz could generate from using our tool.

# Functions
- Overall Sentiment Analysis – do people like Mercedes


- Sentiment Analysis of top comments – what do opinion leaders think


- Understand what people like the most about your product or service – What are the most often positively mentioned features?


- Analyse the sentiment of a specific feature or design element – What people like/dislike about the engine/design/interior


- Compare your products across your product offering and to the competition – Do people prefer the A/C/B – Class or do they like BMW more

# Team
Our team consisted of Oday Almajed, George Farajalla, Meng-Chen Hung, Maria Joyce, Juan Pablo Larrondo Petricio, Ignacio Mouawad, Christoph Stehling (me).
